# WaterPaintedStick
Simple Unity platformer. All art is waterpainted. The story is about a stickman finding a goal for his life.

The aim of the project is to learn more about unity. Maybe learn about how to cooperate with others on a game? 

This platformer aims to be a story driven, psychologial platformer.

Update! demo out!
As of february This demo took me about 2,5 months/ 100 hours to make. 

The art, programming, bg-music, story and lv design were all done by me. 

## Future plans:

Next: create a "making of" video 

1. Collect feedback. Depending on it I will either
- focus on creating more levels
- or improve gameplay (allot)
- might make slow motion effect and 'focus collectables'
- add wall jumping,

### Next levels I'm planning:
1. The jungle of choices
2. meditation cloud level
3. The shadow caves
4. The mountain of destiny

I will probably change the order as well
