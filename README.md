# WaterPaintedStick
Unity version 2019.4.16f1

# Introduction
Simple Unity platformer. All art is waterpainted. The story is about a stickman finding a goal for his life.

# Learning
The aim of the project is to learn more about unity. I've only worked with Unity for a couple of months, and only programmed for about a year. This project's aim is to keep things simple. Simple often repeated becomes master. If the basics are mastered.. you can move on to more complicated stuff.
This project is done by and create for beginners. Also in a gaming sence. It should be rather easy to play. 

# Target audience
Beginner players. All ages. Non violent, no monsters or other scary stuff. A little girl of 2 should be able to watch her daddy or mommy play this game and not get nightmares.

# Scope
The scope of the project is about 4 months. So I will probably finish in April/May of 2021

# Planned Sprints
The planned sprints I want to do are:

- 50% - waterpainted tree level
- moving plantforms
- levers (small)
- make spiral level
- create first demo
- dissapearing platforms
- new level
- new level
- new level
- new level
- credits
- saving and loading
- some polish
- ? - upgrade rendering to add lighting

? - = that I don't know yet if I should do it.
20% - = someone (probably me) is working on it, now at that percentage.

Feel free to update this readme and track your process in this project as well.

# art assets
All Art assets are water painted and conferted to png. You can find them in the art folder. There is way more then I used. 

# how to join
I especially need more levels, so if you feel up to making a level for this project, feel free to do so.
You can also choose to do one of the mentioned sprints. Or something else if the spirit moves you. 

Before committing: Please create a branch and commit your changes there. 

The structure of the game should be quite obvious, please make use of it. If you don't understand it, that's ok.
